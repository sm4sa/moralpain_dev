# Assumption

The developer has cloned this repo on his or her host machine, rather than
in a dev container. It only makes one difference: when you clone it onto a
host machine, then the emulator set-up scripts in the bin directory here are
immediately available to be run on the host machine. Otherwise you'll have
to save them to the local machine before you can run them there.
