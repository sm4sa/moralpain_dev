# External
These are tools and libraries used for development. We prefer not to have these
checked into version control but at the moment, we have not implemented a
better solution.

### TODOs
`openapi-generator-cli.jar` should become part of our docker image.

`typedb-server-mac-2.12.0.zip` is for integration tests of our lambdas. We prefer
not to have our tests depend on this but it seems to be what vaticle does
upstream.
